The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency states that the vast majority of plant and refinery accidents are due to a lack of safety regulations, poor equipment design, inadequate maintenance, or failure to respond to warnings. Not wearing the right safety protections, inadequately training employees, or choosing to ignore an environmental hazard are all examples of how failing to follow safety guidelines could result in a refinery or oil plant accident. Other dangers at plants and refineries include:</p><ul><li>Slips and Falls</li><li>Falling objects from great heights</li><li>The careless use of heavy machinery</li><li>Products or tools that are defective</li><li>Explosions and fires</li><li>Chemical burns and inhalation of toxic fumes</li><li>Transporting or storing hazardous material in an improper manner</li></ul><p>If these conditions were due to negligence by another party, an injured worker at a plant or refinery can begin their claim for compensation with one of our Houston lawyers.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.mithofflaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/shutterstock_139917064-750x500.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Houston Refinery Accident Lawyer" data-cke-saved-src=" https://www.mithofflaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/shutterstock_139917064-750x500.jpg"></p><h2>If Your Employer At A Refinery Plant Carries Workers' Compensation</h2><p>You can claim benefits if your employer has workers' comp insurance. You may qualify for the following benefits if you sustain an injury on the job:</p><ul><li>Medical benefits for the explosion-related injuries or illness</li><li>Partially replacing lost wages with income benefits</li><li>If a loved one has passed away, funeral and death benefits are available</li></ul><p>These benefits are often not available to workers because employers and their insurance companies don't always make it simple for them. If your employer provides them, you may be entitled. However, it can sometimes prove difficult to file for them.</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.zehllaw.com/plant-refinery-accident-lawyers/">Houston refinery explosion lawyers</a> can guide you through the claim filing process, helping to ensure that all necessary information is included and your initial claim is accepted. You can appeal a denied benefits claim.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 3, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/authors/accident-lawyer/" rel="author">Accident Lawyer</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/houston-refinery-and-plant-accident-compensation-with-lawyer.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Houston Refinery and Plant Accident Compensation with Lawyer</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/what-are-the-houston-areas-refineries-and-how-would-lawyers-help.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> What are the Houston Area&#x27;s Refineries and how would Lawyers help? </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T09:41" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/houston-construction-refinery-accident-lawyers-making-a-difference-for-injured-workers.html">Houston Construction-Refinery Accident Lawyers Making A Difference For Injured Workers</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T09:40" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/what-are-the-houston-areas-refineries-and-how-would-lawyers-help.html">What are the Houston Area&#x27;s Refineries and how would Lawyers help?</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T09:34" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/houston-refinery-and-plant-accident-compensation-with-lawyer.html">Houston Refinery and Plant Accident Compensation with Lawyer</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Houston Refinery Accident Lawyer</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
