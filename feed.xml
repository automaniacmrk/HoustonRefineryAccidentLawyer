                <h2>Houston Construction-Refinery Accident Lawyers Making A Difference For Injured Workers</h2>

<h2>Some of the worst plant and refinery explosions in history have been caused by combustible dust</h2>
<ul>
<li>Agriculture includes tobacco, grain, sugar and fertilizer processing</li>
<li>Food processing and manufacturing</li>
<li>Fossil fuel generation</li>
<li>Manufacturing furniture</li>
<li>Processing of metal</li>
<li>Pesticide manufacturing</li>
<li>Pharmaceuticals</li>
<li>Processing plastics</li>
<li>Processing of pulp and paper</li>
<li>Operation Recycling</li>
</ul>
<p>If industrial dust is in sufficient quantities, it will ignite an explosion when it comes into direct contact with an ignition source. Secondary explosions can occur when additional combustible particles are dispersed into the atmosphere and come in contact with heat. In fact, according to OSHA, most deaths in combustible dust explosions are the result of secondary explosions.</p>
<p>Combustible dust has caused some of the worst industrial disasters in recent history, including a fatal explosion that tragically killed 14 workers at the Imperial Sugar plant in Wentworth, Georgia, in February 2008. Many others were also hurt including those who suffered life-threatening burns.</p>
<p>Trump's administration thwarted efforts to create a mandatory standard for combustible powder in the aftermath of the Imperial Sugar catastrophe. OSHA established the Combustible dust National Emphasis program (NEP) and guidelines for workers to reduce dust hazards. Those voluntary guidelines recommend that employers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dust must be contained within your equipment.</li>
<li>Use a dust collection device to collect any dust that is not contained at the time of release.</li>
<li>Clean up any dust not contained or captured.</li>
</ul>

                <h2>What are the Houston Area's Refineries and how would Lawyers help?</h2>
<p>Ten major oil refineries are located in the Houston metropolitan area. These refineries process more than half of Texas' oil production, according to the Greater Houston Partnership. More than one-fourth the oil produced in America is processed by refineries located in Texas' other regions, such as Port Arthur, Galveston Corpus Christi Baytown and Beaumont.</p>
<p>This means that thousands of Texas workers are working in the refineries. The Houston Chronicle reported in 2020 that Texas as a whole boasts nearly 150,000 workers in the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p>Refineries play an important role in the economy of Houston and all of Texas. As a result, it is important for oil and gas workers to know their rights if they are injured in an accident or explosion on the job.</p>

<h2>What causes construction and oil refinery accidents?</h2>
<p>OSHA states that there are more fatal incidents at refineries than in the three other highest-ranking industries. OSHA reports that 36 refinery deaths were due to a gaseous leakage between 1992 and 2007. From these refinery accidents, 52 employee deaths 250 injuries stemmed from the incidents. It would stand to reason then, that every year an average of three people die and 16 are injured in the construction and maintenance of oil refineries. However, these numbers are deceivingly low.</p>
<p>In an attempt to make their plants seem safe, oil refineries hire as many contractors as possible. When reporting injuries and deaths, they do not have to "claim" contractors as they are not employees of the petroleum companies.</p>
<p>These are the most common causes of accidents in construction and accidents at oil refineries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explosions</li>
<li>Feuers</li>
<li>Equipment failure</li>
<li>Exposure to Chemicals</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have the right to claim compensation if you're injured by negligence at work, be it in an oil refinery, or on a construction site. This law was created to make sure that contractors and employees can work together in safety.</p>
<p>Refineries and employers have a responsibility to ensure that workers feel safe while performing their duties.Call our <a href="https://www.zehllaw.com/plant-refinery-accident-lawyers/">injury attorneys today for any accident at a refinery in Houston</a> for help filing your claim. Our firm will investigate every detail surrounding your case until we find out what occurred and who is responsible for your accident.</p>
<p>Refinery workers labeled as contractors often get the most dangerous jobs. If you are contracted to work at an oil refinery, you may be at serious risk. If you are injured or killed, you may be brushed off by the refinery, leaving your family without the resources you need to get back on their feet. Refineries are concerned about safety ratings and liability, not about the well-being of their labor force.</p>
<p>This is not acceptable. We will take action on your behalf to ensure you get proper justice for your injuries.</p>

                <h2>Lawyers that can help with Common Types Of Plant And Refinery Accidents Houston</h2>
<p>Due to heavy machinery and hazardous substances, as well as the complex tools that are used in an industrial plant or refinery, it is important to follow the safety regulations set forth by the federal authorities and the site supervisors. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency states that the vast majority of plant and refinery accidents are due to a lack of safety regulations, poor equipment design, inadequate maintenance, or failure to respond to warnings. Not wearing the right safety protections, inadequately training employees, or choosing to ignore an environmental hazard are all examples of how failing to follow safety guidelines could result in a refinery or oil plant accident. Other dangers at plants and refineries include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slips and Falls</li>
<li>Falling objects from great heights</li>
<li>The careless use of heavy machinery</li>
<li>Products or tools that are defective</li>
<li>Explosions and fires</li>
<li>Chemical burns and inhalation of toxic fumes</li>
<li>Transporting or storing hazardous material in an improper manner</li>
</ul>
<p>If these conditions were due to negligence by another party, an injured worker at a plant or refinery can begin their claim for compensation with one of our Houston lawyers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.mithofflaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/shutterstock_139917064-750x500.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Houston Refinery Accident Lawyer" data-cke-saved-src=" https://www.mithofflaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/shutterstock_139917064-750x500.jpg"></p>
<h2>If Your Employer At A Refinery Plant Carries Workers' Compensation</h2>
<p>You can claim benefits if your employer has workers' comp insurance. You may qualify for the following benefits if you sustain an injury on the job:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medical benefits for the explosion-related injuries or illness</li>
<li>Partially replacing lost wages with income benefits</li>
<li>If a loved one has passed away, funeral and death benefits are available</li>
</ul>
<p>These benefits are often not available to workers because employers and their insurance companies don't always make it simple for them. If your employer provides them, you may be entitled. However, it can sometimes prove difficult to file for them.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.zehllaw.com/plant-refinery-accident-lawyers/">Houston refinery explosion lawyers</a> can guide you through the claim filing process, helping to ensure that all necessary information is included and your initial claim is accepted. You can appeal a denied benefits claim.</p>

<h2>How Will A Refinery Accident Attorney Help Your Claim?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.zehllaw.com/plant-refinery-accident-lawyers/">role of a Houston refinery accident attorney</a> will be multifaceted. The victims of explosion accidents do not have enough resources to pursue well-funded refinery and oil companies. However, an attorney can use their resources to handle every aspect of the claim.</p>
<p>An experienced attorney can work alongside both federal and state regulators, as well as with law enforcement officers and the refinery companies to determine what actually happened. An attorney will gather various types of evidence in order to prove liability, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety records for refinery companies</li>
<li>Training and safety records of the employees</li>
<li>Any photo or video surveillance available from the Internet</li>
<li>Statements by eyewitnesses</li>
<li>Experts in accident reconstruction</li>
</ul>
<h2>Helping Clients Injured In Refinery And Oil Explosions Throughout The Houston Area</h2>
<p>Refinery explosions and accidents can cause tragic consequences for those workers and others unfortunate enough to be involved. The blast of a refinery or oil explosion can leave individuals critically injured, burned, maimed, and dead. The impact of such explosions, with shock waves, attendant fires, falling debris, and fumes can involve vast numbers of people, both workers and people living nearby. Explosions and accidents may occur in any type of refinery, including oil, chemical, and sugar refineries.</p>
<p>You or someone close to you may have been hurt in a refining explosion or other accident. It is important that you consult a Houston injury attorney at Zehl &amp; Associates. There may be grounds to file an injury case due to negligence or other wrongdoing by the responsible parties. An injury attorney at the firm can evaluate your case, advise you of your legal rights, and initiate appropriate legal action on your behalf.</p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.zehllaw.com/wp-content/uploads/Texas-Refinery-Accident-Lawyer-Best-Houston-Refinery-Injury-Lawyer.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Houston Refinery Accident Lawyer" width="80%" height="auto"></h2>
<h2>The Refinery Explosion Legal Claim Could Offer You Compensation</h2>
<p>Every case is different, but types of damages that may be pursued in an injury claim include compensation for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medical bills</li>
<li>Lost wages</li>
<li>Lost or reduced earning capacity</li>
<li>Physical pain, emotional trauma and physical suffering can cause severe pain.</li>
<li>Punitive damages for especially bad negligence</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're a spouse, child, or parent of someone who died in a refinery explosion, you may be able to get compensation through a wrongful death lawsuit. Compensation could include payment for funeral and burial expenses, medical treatment, lost earnings, lost love and support and more. (You may also be able to bring a survival action.)</p>
<p>There are no two cases alike and the compensation available can be very different. We'll advise you about a possible value range based on your damages.</p>
<h2>Houston Oil Refinery Accident Lawyer</h2>
<p>Texas's oil refineries play a vital role in the economy. Houston has 10 major oil refineries that produce about 2.6 million barrels of crude oil per day - 14.3 percent of the national oil production. The Texas oil and gas industry provides thousands of jobs to Texans. Unfortunately, oil refinery workers are not always safe at work. Workers can be seriously injured or killed by oil refinery accident, such as fires and explosions. At Zehl &amp; Associates, we represent workers who've been injured in oil refinery accidents, as well as surviving family members after fatal disasters. Find out how our Houston oil refinery accident lawyer can help you today during a free case evaluation in Houston.</p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://jdsilvalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Refinery-Accidents-Explosions.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Houston Refinery Accident Lawyer" width="80%" height="auto"></h2>
<h2>How Does An Oil Refinery Operate?</h2>
<p>Refineries separate crude oil into various components called fractions. This is done by taking advantage the boiling points for each fraction. The process begins with a system called fractional distillation. The crude oil will be heated up to about 720 F. Hot liquid and vapors will enter a distillation column where the vapors cool as they rise. The vapors will condense onto collection trays of different heights. These liquids, such as kerosene, will be sent to other units for further processing. To make different types of fuel, you must manipulate the liquid molecules. By using a cracking unit, you can form a smaller chain that creates a heavier fuel. This is a basic overview showing us how an oil refinery makes different types of fuel.</p>
<p>You may assume that the most dangerous time for an oil refinery is when workers are producing fuel. However, during a refinery turnaround, more than 30,000 separate procedures are performed. Many people are tasked with moving explosive products in and out of position when the unit is being overhauled or updated. One mistake could result in an accident that causes you permanent physical damage. Workers must remain alert when a refinery goes through transition. They also need to follow safety protocols. Refineries spend the spring months knee-deep in maintenance, hiring contractors and preparing for summer's high fuel demand. This information will be used by our refinery accident lawyers to investigate the scene. We will make sure that the oil company is following proper safety protocol during the maintenance off-season.</p>
<h2>Suing For Injuries Near An Oil Refinery Explosion</h2>
<p>Even though the incident occurred at an oil refinery, anyone who was near it could have suffered serious injuries. People who live near the refinery could have suffered damage to their house that might have caused partial collapses or structural damage along with personal injuries. You could also have suffered injury if you lived in an area near the refinery, such as a fire or explosion.</p>
<p>Ask a lawyer about how to sue a facility that produces explosions that inflict injury or damage to people nearby.</p>

<h2>Liability For Plant, Industrial, And Refinery Explosions</h2>
<p>It is not only employers that can be held liable for paying damages after a plant, industrial, and refinery explosion. You may be entitled to workers' comp benefits but there are also other people you could hold responsible through a personal injury case. The following parties are eligible:</p>
<ul>
<li>The explosion was caused by defective equipment manufactured by the manufacturers</li>
<li>Failure to properly label dangerous materials and equipment by companies</li>
<li>Companies that own and operate tanker trucks entering and exiting the refinery</li>
<li>Parties involved in the construction of the plant, including contractors and sub-contractors</li>
</ul>
<p>An attorney will examine your case to determine who you should hold responsible for the highest compensation.</p>

<h2>Oil Refinery Workers Are Injured in Explosions</h2>
<p>Texas' workers are frequently governed by state worker's compensation rules. These rules would have an injured worker file for compensation through an insurance system. The system reimburses you for the 66.7% loss of wages and pays medical bills for only those doctors you choose. Workers in Texas have the option to opt out from this system. We might file a lawsuit for you instead. This will fight to obtain 100% of your compensation and further damages for disfigurement and pain.</p>
<p>These lawsuits are filed directly against an employer. You will have to show that your employer is responsible for the explosion. This can be done by proving negligent training or poor maintenance of safety equipment.</p>
<h2>Refinery Explosion Injuries Case: Third-Party Legal Claim</h2>
<p>Workers' compensation offers some benefits but it does not pay enough to cover the severe injuries that oil and gas explosions may cause. If your employer has workers' comp you cannot sue them for more compensation. However, in some instances, third-party lawsuits can be filed by injured workers and their families. Third-party suits are legal claims against an individual or entity other than your employer who caused the accident. A third party could be another company contracting at the refinery, well, or other location; a manufacturer of refining equipment that is defective; or another party.</p>
<p>When we meet with you and learn the facts, we'll advise you whether a third-party lawsuit could be an option in your case. Call us at (613) 508-0113.</p>

<h2>Refinery and Plant Accident Compensation</h2>
<p>The damages for cases that involve explosions, fires or other incidents at refineries and plants are usually very large due to the high number of victims and extent of the injuries. There are hundreds of deaths and serious injuries from the worst oil and natural gas accidents.</p>
<p>Your individual losses will determine the amount of compensation you are entitled to. You may recover damages for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health expenses</li>
<li>Lost wages</li>
<li>If you're unable or unwilling to work, your earning potential is lost.</li>
<li>Out-of-pocket expenses related to your injury (i.e., medications; a cane, crutches, or wheelchair; travel to and from doctor appointments; modifications to your home and/or vehicle; etc.)</li>
<li>Pain and suffering</li>
<li>Disabilities</li>

<h2>Osha Violations Contribute To The Vast Majority Of Plant And Refinery Explosions</h2>
<p>More than 1000 workers at refineries and plants have been successfully represented by our Undefeated Personal Injuries Attorneys. In every case, the operator's inability to adhere to OSHA safety regulations or other acceptable safety protocols contributed to these catastrophes.</p>
<p>In September 2005, for example, OSHA assessed BP a then-record $21 million fine in connection with the fatal Texas City Refinery explosion. After determining that BP had violated the settlement agreement, OSHA would later levy a $87 million additional fine on BP.</p>
<p>Following the 2010 Kleen Energy explosion, OSHA inspectors uncovered nearly 400 safety violations, including many deemed to be deliberate disregards of safety protocol. Seventeen companies were eventually fined a total of $16.6 million in connection with the incident.</p>
<p>Most recently, the TPC Group received more than $500,000 in fines for OSHA violations uncovered in the wake of November 2019 Port Neches explosion.</p>

<h2>How Much Compensation Can I Receive For My Oil Refinery Explosion Injury?</h2>
<p>Before you agree to a settlement by your insurance company, it is crucial that you accurately calculate the amount of your case involving an oil refinery accident. Insurance companies often try to take advantage of claimants to protect their own profits. This means that an insurer may offer less than the true value of your case in an initial settlement. To understand the value of your case and to negotiate fair financial reimbursement, you should consult a lawyer right from the start.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prognosis and diagnosis of injury.</li>
<li>The level of disability, if any</li>
<li>How you will be able to return to work.</li>
<li>Your age at the time of the accident</li>
<li>You overall health</li>
<li>The insurance coverage available</li>
<li>The number of defendants</li>
<li>Your own actions in connection to the accident (comparative negligence)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although each oil refinery explosion injury case is different, as an injured worker you are entitled to receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>While you're unable to work, your salary and expected hourly earnings.</li>
<li>Payment of all medical expenses related to your injuries, for your lifetime, as wells as the costs of anticipated future medical expenses.</li>
<li>Payment or reimbursement for all expenses that allow you to live at home such as rental or purchase of medical equipment, modifications such as wheelchair ramps, and automobile hand controls if you have lost control of your legs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above, which are called economic damages because they can be assigned a "dollars and cents" value, you are also allowed to receive non-economic damages. These damages compensate you for things that cannot be measured in monetary terms, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "pain and suffering" caused by your injury and during your recovery.</li>
<li>You will be compensated for the inability to participate fully at family events, such as weddings or funerals.</li>
<li>Loss of your wisdom and guidance in making important family decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Texas law permits a court in Texas to order punitive damages. This is to be used to penalize the owner of the refinery for allowing an explosion to occur. Although the amount of these damages is "capped" under Texas law, they can be quite substantial!</p>
<h2>Damages You Can Recover</h2>
<ul>
<li>Past and future wage losses, as well as loss of earning capacity;</li>
<li>Past and future medical expenses;</li>
<li>Mental anguish, physical pain and impairment.</li>
</ul>
<p>As your industrial injury lawyer, Richard Schechter and his team will work hard to ensure the defendant is held responsible for your damages.</p>

<h2>Amputations</h2>
<p>Refineries may use sharp machinery, which can require safety shields to ensure that workers aren't hurt. A refinery accident can result in an employee losing a finger or a leg. It is possible to obtain evidence that proves an employer negligent by contacting a Houston lawyer who specializes in refinery accidents.</p>
<h2>Explosions</h2>
<p>Explosions are a large part of refinery accidents. Any case that involves such an explosion should be treated seriously, regardless of whether it is caused by gas leakage or negligence. Explosions can cause serious injuries or even death.</p>
