These refineries process more than half of Texas' oil production, according to the Greater Houston Partnership. More than one-fourth the oil produced in America is processed by refineries located in Texas' other regions, such as Port Arthur, Galveston Corpus Christi Baytown and Beaumont.</p><p>This means that thousands of Texas workers are working in the refineries. The Houston Chronicle reported in 2020 that Texas as a whole boasts nearly 150,000 workers in the oil and gas industry.</p><p>Refineries play an important role in the economy of Houston and all of Texas. As a result, it is important for oil and gas workers to know their rights if they are injured in an accident or explosion on the job.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn1.pegasaas.io/32a4/img/wp-content/themes/cws-theme-work-mix/assets/images/team---388x328.png" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Houston Refinery Accident Lawyer" data-cke-saved-src=" https://cdn1.pegasaas.io/32a4/img/wp-content/themes/cws-theme-work-mix/assets/images/team---388x328.png"></p><h2>What causes construction and oil refinery accidents?</h2><p>OSHA states that there are more fatal incidents at refineries than in the three other highest-ranking industries. OSHA reports that 36 refinery deaths were due to a gaseous leakage between 1992 and 2007. From these refinery accidents, 52 employee deaths 250 injuries stemmed from the incidents. It would stand to reason then, that every year an average of three people die and 16 are injured in the construction and maintenance of oil refineries. However, these numbers are deceivingly low.</p><p>In an attempt to make their plants seem safe, oil refineries hire as many contractors as possible. When reporting injuries and deaths, they do not have to "claim" contractors as they are not employees of the petroleum companies.</p><p>These are the most common causes of accidents in construction and accidents at oil refineries:</p><ul><li>Explosions</li><li>Feuers</li><li>Equipment failure</li><li>Exposure to Chemicals</li></ul><p>You may have the right to claim compensation if you're injured by negligence at work, be it in an oil refinery, or on a construction site. This law was created to make sure that contractors and employees can work together in safety.</p><p>Refineries and employers have a responsibility to ensure that workers feel safe while performing their duties. If you have been injured or someone you love has died as the result of an accident at a refinery, call our injury attorneys today for help filing your claim. Our firm will investigate every detail surrounding your case until we find out what occurred and who is responsible for your accident.</p><p>Refinery workers labeled as contractors often get the most dangerous jobs. If you are contracted to work at an oil refinery, you may be at serious risk. If you are injured or killed, you may be brushed off by the refinery, leaving your family without the resources you need to get back on their feet. Refineries are concerned about safety ratings and liability, not about the well-being of their labor force.</p><p>This is not acceptable. We will take action on your behalf to ensure you get proper justice for your injuries.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 22, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/authors/accident-lawyer/" rel="author">Accident Lawyer</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/lawyers-that-can-help-with-common-types-of-plant-and-refinery-accidents-houston.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Lawyers that can help with Common Types Of Plant And Refinery Accidents Houston</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/houston-construction-refinery-accident-lawyers-making-a-difference-for-injured-workers.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Houston Construction-Refinery Accident Lawyers Making A Difference For Injured Workers </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T09:41" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/houston-construction-refinery-accident-lawyers-making-a-difference-for-injured-workers.html">Houston Construction-Refinery Accident Lawyers Making A Difference For Injured Workers</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T09:37" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/lawyers-that-can-help-with-common-types-of-plant-and-refinery-accidents-houston.html">Lawyers that can help with Common Types Of Plant And Refinery Accidents Houston</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T09:34" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/houston-refinery-and-plant-accident-compensation-with-lawyer.html">Houston Refinery and Plant Accident Compensation with Lawyer</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Houston Refinery Accident Lawyer</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
