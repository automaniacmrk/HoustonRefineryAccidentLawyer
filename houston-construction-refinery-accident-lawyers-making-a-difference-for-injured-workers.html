Secondary explosions can occur when additional combustible particles are dispersed into the atmosphere and come in contact with heat. In fact, according to OSHA, most deaths in combustible dust explosions are the result of secondary explosions.</p><p>Combustible dust has caused some of the worst industrial disasters in recent history, including a fatal explosion that tragically killed 14 workers at the Imperial Sugar plant in Wentworth, Georgia, in February 2008. Many others were also hurt including those who suffered life-threatening burns.</p><p>Trump's administration thwarted efforts to create a mandatory standard for combustible powder in the aftermath of the Imperial Sugar catastrophe. OSHA established the Combustible dust National Emphasis program (NEP) and guidelines for workers to reduce dust hazards. Those voluntary guidelines recommend that employers:</p><ul><li>Dust must be contained within your equipment.</li><li>Use a dust collection device to collect any dust that is not contained at the time of release.</li><li>Clean up any dust not contained or captured.</li></ul></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 22, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/authors/accident-lawyer/" rel="author">Accident Lawyer</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/what-are-the-houston-areas-refineries-and-how-would-lawyers-help.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> What are the Houston Area&#x27;s Refineries and how would Lawyers help?</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T09:40" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/what-are-the-houston-areas-refineries-and-how-would-lawyers-help.html">What are the Houston Area&#x27;s Refineries and how would Lawyers help?</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T09:37" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/lawyers-that-can-help-with-common-types-of-plant-and-refinery-accidents-houston.html">Lawyers that can help with Common Types Of Plant And Refinery Accidents Houston</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T09:34" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/houston-refinery-and-plant-accident-compensation-with-lawyer.html">Houston Refinery and Plant Accident Compensation with Lawyer</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Houston Refinery Accident Lawyer</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
