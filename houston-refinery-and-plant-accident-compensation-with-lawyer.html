If you lose a loved one in a fire, explosion, or other accident at a plant or a refinery, our lawyers can pursue a wrongful death claim on your family's behalf.</p><p>Your family's losses will determine the damages that can be recovered in a wrongful-death claim. Generally, you may be able to recover compensation for:</p><ul><li>Lost income</li><li>Inheritance and benefits lost</li><li>Cost of funeral services and burial or cremation</li><li>Household services and care taken away</li><li>Medical expenses prior to your loved one's death</li><li>Loss of consortium, care, and companionship</li><li>If the decedent had children, loss of parental guidance</li></ul><p>Losing a close friend or loved one can be devastating emotionally. This can cause financial hardship for your loved ones. If your loved one worked in oil and gas and his or her death is the result of negligence on the part of the company or another party, you deserve to be compensated.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 22, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/authors/accident-lawyer/" rel="author">Accident Lawyer</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/houston-refinery-accident-lawyer.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Houston Refinery Accident Lawyer</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/lawyers-that-can-help-with-common-types-of-plant-and-refinery-accidents-houston.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Lawyers that can help with Common Types Of Plant And Refinery Accidents Houston </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T09:41" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/houston-construction-refinery-accident-lawyers-making-a-difference-for-injured-workers.html">Houston Construction-Refinery Accident Lawyers Making A Difference For Injured Workers</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T09:40" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/what-are-the-houston-areas-refineries-and-how-would-lawyers-help.html">What are the Houston Area&#x27;s Refineries and how would Lawyers help?</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T09:37" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/lawyers-that-can-help-with-common-types-of-plant-and-refinery-accidents-houston.html">Lawyers that can help with Common Types Of Plant And Refinery Accidents Houston</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Houston Refinery Accident Lawyer</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HoustonRefineryAccidentLawyer/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
